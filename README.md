# Implementation-of-some-parallel-algorithms

This repository includes implementations of 4 parallel algorithms (**PSRA**, **KMP**, **simple matrix multiplication** and **Cannon 
algorithm**) . They are assignments of the course *"Parallel Computing Program Design"* I take in Beihang University this semester.
